import { computed, reactive } from 'vue';

/** Extend this class to make your class reactive. The entire source code of
 * `ReactiveClass` is:
 * ```ts
 * import { reactive } from 'vue';
 *
 * export class ReactiveClass {
 *   constructor() {
 *     return reactive(this);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * Warnings:
 * - For computed properties, use `computedAsAFunction()` instead of
 *   `computed()`. This avoids problems where `this.computedThing` will
 *   sometimes be an unwrapped value and sometimes be a computed ref. (See
 *   https://github.com/davidbludlow/vue-data-structures/blob/main/brainstorm/rejected-idea-7-alias-of-computed.md
 *   for more details.)
 * - Do not use `ref()` - instead just set the value directly on `this`. The
 *   reason is that `reactive()` will unwrap refs, but TypeScript will still
 *   expect you to use `.value`, leading to type mismatches.
 * - Doesn't work with Vue 2.
 * - Don't use private properties (`#` or `private` keyword). If you do, then
 *   there will be problems where `new ReactiveFoo()` will not have the same
 *   TypeScript type as `reactive(new ReactiveFoo())`.
 *
 * Less-certain tips:
 * - Sometimes it is nicer to have regular getters, not backed by
 *   `computedAsAFunction`. It makes for cleaner code. Someday, somebody should
 *   do some research to determine if it is possible for a regular getter, in
 *   some circumstances, to be more performant than a computed. (Though,
 *   obviously computed would be more performant in many circumstances.)
 * - It might be better to make a composable instead of using `ReactiveClass`.
 * - Don't use `watch` or `watchEffect` in the constructor of a `ReactiveClass`
 *   unless you know what you are doing with effect scopes. The effect scope
 *   will control when the watcher is disposed. Even if you do know how effect
 *   scopes work, it still might be better to put watchers elsewhere to make
 *   their disposal timing more obvious to other programmers.

/**

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * class MyClass extends ReactiveClass {
 *   foo = 4;
 *
 *   // Simple way:
 *   getDoubleFoo = computedAsAFunction(() => this.foo * 2);
 *
 *   // Getter/setter way:
 *   _getTripleFoo = computedAsAFunction(() => this.foo * 3); // ‚Üê Don't mark this `private`
 *   get tripleFoo() {
 *     return this._getTripleFoo();
 *   }
 *   set tripleFoo(value) {
 *     this.foo = value / 3;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
